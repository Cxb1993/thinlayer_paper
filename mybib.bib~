	abstract = {We review the development of diffuse-interface models of hydrodynamics and their application to a wide variety of interfacial phenomena. These models have been applied successfully to situations in which the physical phenomena of interest have a length scale commensurate with the thickness of the interfacial region (e.g. near-critical interfacial phenomena or small-scale flows such as those occurring near contact lines) and fluid flows involving large interface deformations and/or topological changes (e.g. breakup and coalescence events associated with fluid jets, droplets, and large-deformation waves). We discuss the issues involved in formulating diffuse-interface models for single-component and binary fluids. Recent applications and computations using these models are discussed in each case. Further, we address issues including sharp-interface analyses that relate these models to the classical free-boundary problem, computational approaches to describe interfacial phenomena, and models of fully miscible fluids.},

abstract = {Through numerous illustrative examples and comments, Applied Functional Analysis, Second Edition demonstrates the rigor of logic and systematic, mathematical thinking. It presents the mathematical foundations that lead to classical results in functional analysis. More specifically, the text prepares students to learn the variational theory of partial differential equations, distributions and Sobolev spaces, and numerical analysis with an emphasis on finite element \{methods.While\} retaining the structure of its best-selling predecessor, this second edition includes revisions of many original examples, along with new examples that often reflect the authors' own vast research experiences and perspectives. This edition also provides many more exercises as well as a solutions manual for qualifying instructors. Each chapter begins with an extensive introduction and concludes with a summary and historical comments that frequently refer to other sources. New to the Second \{EditionCompletely\} revised section on lim sup and lim inf New discussions of connected sets, probability, Bayesian statistical inference, and the generalized (integral) Minkowski \{inequalityNew\} sections on elements of multilinear algebra and determinants, the singular value decomposition theorem, the Cauchy principal value, and Hadamard finite part \{integralsNew\} example of a Lebesgue non-measurable \{setIdeal\} for a two-semester course, this proven textbook teaches students how to prove theorems and prepares them for further study of more advanced mathematical topics. It helps them succeed in formulating research questions in a mathematically rigorous way.},

@article{Liang2009,
abstract = {Many natural terrains have complicated surface topography. The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wet–dry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wet–dry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps.},

abstract = {We present a phase-field model (PFM) for solidification in binary alloys, which is found from the phase-field model for a pure material by direct comparison of the variables for a pure material solidification and alloy solidification. The model appears to be equivalent with the Wheeler-Boettinger-McFadden (WBM) model [A.A. Wheeler, W. J. Boettinger, and G. B. McFadden, Phys. Rev. A 45, 7424 (1992)], but has a different definition of the free energy density for interfacial region. An extra potential originated from the free energy density definition in the WBM model disappears in this model. At a dilute solution limit, the model is reduced to the Tiaden et al. model [Physica D 115, 73 (1998)] for a binary alloy. A relationship between the phase-field mobility and the interface kinetics coefficient is derived at a thin-interface limit condition under an assumption of negligible diffusivity in the solid phase. For a dilute alloy, a steady-state solution of the concentration profile across the diffuse interface is obtained as a function of the interface velocity and the resultant partition coefficient is compared with the previous solute trapping model. For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface PFM are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. As the partition coefficient becomes close to unit at high interface velocities, whereas, the sharp-interface PFM yields the correct answer.},

@article{Castro2005a,
abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical difficulties related to the appearance of the so-called wet/dry fronts that may occur during the simulation of free-surface waves in shallow fluids and internal waves in stratified fluids composed by two shallow layers of immiscible liquids. In the one-layer case, the fluid is supposed to be governed by the shallow water equations. In the case of two layers, the system to solve is formulated under the form of two-coupled system of shallow water equations. In both cases, the discretization of the equations are performed by means of the Q-schemes of Roe upwinding the source term developed in  1. and 2. for the one-layer system, and [3] for the two-layer system. These schemes satisfy the so-called C-property: they solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest. In order to handle properly with wet/dry fronts, a numerical scheme has to verify also an extended C-property: it has to solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest including wet/dry transitions. In  4., 5. and 6., some numerical schemes satisfying this property has been obtained. In this paper, we propose an improvement of these schemes and its extension to two-layer systems. We present some numerical results: for one-layer fluids, we compare the numerical results with some measurements corresponding to a physical model. For two-layer systems, we use the numerical scheme to perform a lock-exchange experiment, and we verify its validity by comparing the steady state reached with an approximate solution obtained by Armi and Farmer in 7. and 8. by using a simplified model.},

abstract = {The Savage-Hutter (SH) avalanche model is a depth-averaged dynamical model of a fluid-like continuum implementing the following simplifying assumptions: (i) density preserving, (ii) shallowness of the avalanche piles and small topographic curvatures, (iii) Coulomb-type sliding with bed friction angle delta and (iv) Mohr-Coulomb behaviour in the interior with internal angle of friction phi> or =delta and an ad hoc assumption reducing the number of Mohr's circles in three-dimensional stress states to one. We scrutinize the available literature on information regarding these assumptions and thus delineate the ranges of validity of the proposed model equations. The discussion is limited to relatively large snow avalanches with negligible powder snow component and laboratory sand avalanches starting on steep slopes. The conclusion of the analysis is that the SH model is a valid model for sand avalanches, but its Mohr-Coulomb sliding law may have to be complemented for snow avalanches by a second velocity-dependent contribution. For very small snow avalanches and for laboratory avalanches starting on moderately steep and bumpy slopes it may not be adequate.},

@article{Pitman2005,
abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

abstract = "We devise new numerical algorithms, called \{PSC\} algorithms, for following fronts propagating with curvature-dependent speed. The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems. "

abstract = "The 18–24 January 1913 eruption of Colima Volcano consisted of three eruptive phases that produced a complex sequence of tephra fall, pyroclastic surges and pyroclastic flows, with a total volume of 1.1 km3 (0.31 km3 DRE). Among these events, the pyroclastic flows are most interesting because their generation mechanisms changed with time. They started with gravitanional dome collapse (block-and-ash flow deposits, Merapi-type), changed to dome collapse triggered by a Vulcanian explosion (block-and-ash flow deposits, Soufrière-type), then ended with the partial collapse of a Plinian column (ash-flow deposits rich in pumice or scoria,). The best exposures of these deposits occur in the southern gullies of the volcano where Heim Coefficients (H/L) were obtained for the various types of flows. Average H/L values of these deposits varied from 0.40 for the Merapi-type (similar to the block-and-ash flow deposits produced during the 1991 and 1994 eruptions), 0.26 for the Soufrière-type events, and 0.17–0.26 for the column collapse ash flows. Additionally, the information of 1991, 1994 and 1998–1999 pyroclastic flow events was used to delimit hazard zones. In order to reconstruct the paths, velocities, and extents of the 20th Century pyroclastic flows, a series of computer simulations were conducted using the program \{FLOW3D\} with appropriate Heim coefficients and apparent viscosities. The model results provide a basis for estimating the areas and levels of hazard that could be associated with the next probable worst-case scenario eruption of the volcano. Three areas were traced according to the degree of hazard and pyroclastic flow type recurrence through time. Zone 1 has the largest probability to be reached by short runout (&lt;5 km) Merapi and Soufrière pyroclastic flows, that have occurred every 3 years during the last decade. Zone 2 might be affected by Soufriere-type pyroclastic flows (∼9 km long) similar to those produced during phase \{II\} of the 1913 eruption. Zone 3 will only be affected by pyroclastic flows (∼15 km long) formed by the collapse of a Plinian eruptive column, like that of the 1913 climactic eruption. Today, an eruption of the same magnitude as that of 1913 would affect about 15,000 inhabitants of small villages, ranches and towns located within 15 km south of the volcano. Such towns include Yerbabuena, and Becerrera in the State of Colima, and Tonila, San Marcos, Cofradia, and Juan Barragán in the State of Jalisco. "

abstract = "A series of pristine block-and-ash flow deposits from the May–June 2006 eruption of Merapi represent an exceptional record of small-volume pyroclastic flows generated by gravitational lava-dome collapses over a period of about two months. The deposits form nine overlapping lobes reaching ~&#xa0;7 km from the summit in the Gendol River valley on the volcano's southern flank, which were produced by successive flows generated during and after the major dome-collapse event on June 14. Both, single pulse (post-June 14 events) and multiple-pulse pyroclastic flows generated by sustained dome collapses on June 14 are recognised and three types of deposits, spread over an area of 4.7 km², are distinguished, totalling 13.3&#xa0;×&#xa0;106 m3: (1) valley-confined basal avalanche deposits (11.7&#xa0;×&#xa0;106 m3) in the Gendol River valley, (2) overbank pyroclastic-flow and associated surge deposits (1.4&#xa0;×&#xa0;106 m3), where parts of the basal avalanche spread laterally onto interfluves and were subsequently channeled into the surrounding river valleys and (3) dilute ash-cloud surge deposits (0.2&#xa0;×&#xa0;106 m3) along valley margins. Variations in the distribution, surface morphology and lithology of the deposits are related to the source materials involved in individual pyroclastic-flow-forming events and varying modes of transport and deposition of the different flows. Inferred flow velocities of the largest block-and-ash flows generated on June 14 vary from 43.8–13.5 m/s for the basal avalanche and from 62.6–24.2 m/s for the ash-cloud surge. The minimum temperatures range from 400 °C for the basal avalanche to 165 °C for the overlying ash cloud. Due to the potential of being re-channeled into adjacent river valleys and flowing laterally away from the main river channel, the overbank pyroclastic flows are considered the most hazardous part of the block-and-ash flow system. The conditions that lead to their development during flow transport and deposition must be taken into account when assessing future pyroclastic flow hazards at Merapi and similar volcanoes elsewhere.
