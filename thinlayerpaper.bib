abstract = {Through numerous illustrative examples and comments, Applied Functional Analysis, Second Edition demonstrates the rigor of logic and systematic, mathematical thinking. It presents the mathematical foundations that lead to classical results in functional analysis. More specifically, the text prepares students to learn the variational theory of partial differential equations, distributions and Sobolev spaces, and numerical analysis with an emphasis on finite element \{methods.While\} retaining the structure of its best-selling predecessor, this second edition includes revisions of many original examples, along with new examples that often reflect the authors' own vast research experiences and perspectives. This edition also provides many more exercises as well as a solutions manual for qualifying instructors. Each chapter begins with an extensive introduction and concludes with a summary and historical comments that frequently refer to other sources. New to the Second \{EditionCompletely\} revised section on lim sup and lim inf New discussions of connected sets, probability, Bayesian statistical inference, and the generalized (integral) Minkowski \{inequalityNew\} sections on elements of multilinear algebra and determinants, the singular value decomposition theorem, the Cauchy principal value, and Hadamard finite part \{integralsNew\} example of a Lebesgue non-measurable \{setIdeal\} for a two-semester course, this proven textbook teaches students how to prove theorems and prepares them for further study of more advanced mathematical topics. It helps them succeed in formulating research questions in a mathematically rigorous way.},

@article{Liang2009,
abstract = {Many natural terrains have complicated surface topography. The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wet–dry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wet–dry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps.},

@article{Kim1999,
abstract = {We present a phase-field model (PFM) for solidification in binary alloys, which is found from the phase-field model for a pure material by direct comparison of the variables for a pure material solidification and alloy solidification. The model appears to be equivalent with the Wheeler-Boettinger-McFadden (WBM) model [A.A. Wheeler, W. J. Boettinger, and G. B. McFadden, Phys. Rev. A 45, 7424 (1992)], but has a different definition of the free energy density for interfacial region. An extra potential originated from the free energy density definition in the WBM model disappears in this model. At a dilute solution limit, the model is reduced to the Tiaden et al. model [Physica D 115, 73 (1998)] for a binary alloy. A relationship between the phase-field mobility and the interface kinetics coefficient is derived at a thin-interface limit condition under an assumption of negligible diffusivity in the solid phase. For a dilute alloy, a steady-state solution of the concentration profile across the diffuse interface is obtained as a function of the interface velocity and the resultant partition coefficient is compared with the previous solute trapping model. For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface PFM are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. As the partition coefficient becomes close to unit at high interface velocities, whereas, the sharp-interface PFM yields the correct answer.},

@article{Castro2005a,
abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical difficulties related to the appearance of the so-called wet/dry fronts that may occur during the simulation of free-surface waves in shallow fluids and internal waves in stratified fluids composed by two shallow layers of immiscible liquids. In the one-layer case, the fluid is supposed to be governed by the shallow water equations. In the case of two layers, the system to solve is formulated under the form of two-coupled system of shallow water equations. In both cases, the discretization of the equations are performed by means of the Q-schemes of Roe upwinding the source term developed in  1. and 2. for the one-layer system, and [3] for the two-layer system. These schemes satisfy the so-called C-property: they solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest. In order to handle properly with wet/dry fronts, a numerical scheme has to verify also an extended C-property: it has to solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest including wet/dry transitions. In  4., 5. and 6., some numerical schemes satisfying this property has been obtained. In this paper, we propose an improvement of these schemes and its extension to two-layer systems. We present some numerical results: for one-layer fluids, we compare the numerical results with some measurements corresponding to a physical model. For two-layer systems, we use the numerical scheme to perform a lock-exchange experiment, and we verify its validity by comparing the steady state reached with an approximate solution obtained by Armi and Farmer in 7. and 8. by using a simplified model.},

@article{Hutter2005,
abstract = {The Savage-Hutter (SH) avalanche model is a depth-averaged dynamical model of a fluid-like continuum implementing the following simplifying assumptions: (i) density preserving, (ii) shallowness of the avalanche piles and small topographic curvatures, (iii) Coulomb-type sliding with bed friction angle delta and (iv) Mohr-Coulomb behaviour in the interior with internal angle of friction phi> or =delta and an ad hoc assumption reducing the number of Mohr's circles in three-dimensional stress states to one. We scrutinize the available literature on information regarding these assumptions and thus delineate the ranges of validity of the proposed model equations. The discussion is limited to relatively large snow avalanches with negligible powder snow component and laboratory sand avalanches starting on steep slopes. The conclusion of the analysis is that the SH model is a valid model for sand avalanches, but its Mohr-Coulomb sliding law may have to be complemented for snow avalanches by a second velocity-dependent contribution. For very small snow avalanches and for laboratory avalanches starting on moderately steep and bumpy slopes it may not be adequate.},

@article{Pitman2005,
abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},
