@article{Akbar2013,
abstract = {In this paper an efficient numerical method based on hybrid finite element and finite volume techniques to solve hurricane induced storm surge flow problem is presented. A segregated implicit projection method is used to solve the 2D shallow water equations on staggered unstructured meshes. The governing equations are written in non-conservation form. An intermediate velocity field is first obtained by solving the momentum equations with the matrix-free implicit cell-centered finite volume method. The nonlinear wave equation is solved by the node-based Galerkin finite element method. This staggered-mesh scheme is distinct from other conventional approaches in that the velocity components and auxiliary variables are stored at cell centers and vertices, respectively. The present model uses an implicit method, which is very efficient and can use a large time step without losing accuracy and stability. The hurricane induced wind stress and pressure, bottom friction, Coriolis effect, and tidal forcing conditions are implemented in this model. The levee overtopping option is implemented in the model as well. Hurricane Katrina (2005) storm surge has been simulated to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the model.},

These models have been applied successfully to situations in which the physical phenomena of interest have a length scale commensurate with the thickness of the interfacial region (e.g. near-critical interfacial phenomena or small-scale flows such as those occurring near contact lines) and fluid flows involving large interface deformations and/or topological changes (e.g. breakup and coalescence events associated with fluid jets, droplets, and large-deformation waves). We discuss the issues involved in formulating diffuse-interface models for single-component and binary fluids. Recent applications and computations using these models are discussed in each case. Further, we address issues including sharp-interface analyses that relate these models to the classical free-boundary problem, computational approaches to describe interfacial phenomena, and models of fully miscible fluids.},

@article{Badalassi,
abstract = {Phase field models offer a systematic physical approach for investigating complex multiphase systems behaviors such as near-critical interfacial phenomena, phase separation under shear, and microstructure evolution during solidification. However, because interfaces are replaced by thin transition regions (diffuse interfaces), phase field simulations require resolution of very thin layers to capture the physics of the problems studied. This demands robust numerical methods that can efficiently achieve high resolution and accuracy, especially in three dimensions. We present here an accurate and efficient numerical method to solve the coupled Cahn-Hilliard/Navier-Stokes system, known as Model H, that constitutes a phase field model for density-matched binary fluids with variable mobility and viscosity. The numerical method is a time-split scheme that combines a novel semi-implicit discretization for the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation with an innovative application of high-resolution schemes employed for direct numerical simulations of turbulence. This new semi-implicit discretization is simple but effective since it removes the stability constraint due to the nonlinearity of the Cahn-Hilliard equation at the same cost as that of an explicit scheme. It is derived from a discretization used for diffusive problems that we further enhance to efficiently solve flow problems with variable mobility and viscosity. Moreover, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations with a robust time-discretization of the projection method that guarantees better stability properties than those for Crank-Nicolson-based projection methods. For channel geometries, the method uses a spectral discretization in the streamwise and spanwise directions and a combination of spectral and high order compact finite difference discretizations in the wall normal direction. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated with several examples including phase separation with, and without, shear in two and three dimensions. The method effectively resolves interfacial layers of as few as three mesh points. The numerical examples show agreement with analytical solutions and scaling laws, where available, and the 3D simulations, in the presence of shear, reveal rich and complex structures, including strings.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of storm surge in hurricane-prone regions is necessary for protecting public and lifeline services and improving resilience. While coastal ocean hydrodynamic models like ADCIRC may be used to assess the extent of inundation, the computational cost may be prohibitive since many local changes corresponding to design and failure scenarios would ideally be considered. We present an exact reanalysis technique and corresponding implementation that enable the assessment of local subdomain changes with less computational effort than would be required by a complete resimulation of the full domain. So long as the subdomain is large enough to fully contain the altered hydrodynamics, changes may be made and simulations performed within it without the need to calculate new boundary values. Accurate results are obtained even when subdomain boundary conditions are forced only intermittently, and convergence is demonstrated by progressively increasing the frequency at which they are applied. Descriptions of the overall methodology, performance results, and accuracy, as well as case studies, are presented.},

@article{Becker2003a,
abstract = {This article surveys a general approach to error control and adaptive mesh design in Galerkin finite element methods that is based on duality principles as used in optimal control. Most of the existing work on a posteriori error analysis deals with error estimation in global norms like the ‘energy norm’ or the L2 norm, involving usually unknown ‘stability constants’. However, in most applications, the error in a global norm does not provide useful bounds for the errors in the quantities of real physical interest. Further, their sensitivity to local error sources is not properly represented by global stability constants. These deficiencies are overcome by employing duality techniques, as is common in a priori error analysis of finite element methods, and replacing the global stability constants by computationally obtained local sensitivity factors. Combining this with Galerkin orthogonality, a posteriori estimates can be derived directly for the error in the target quantity. In these estimates local residuals of the computed solution are multiplied by weights which measure the dependence of the error on the local residuals. Those, in turn, can be controlled by locally refining or coarsening the computational mesh. The weights are obtained by approximately solving a linear adjoint problem. The resulting a posteriori error estimates provide the basis of a feedback process for successively constructing economical meshes and corresponding error bounds tailored to the particular goal of the computation. This approach, called the ‘dual-weighted-residual method’, is introduced initially within an abstract functional analytic setting, and is then developed in detail for several model situations featuring the characteristic properties of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems. After having discussed the basic properties of duality-based adaptivity, we demonstrate the potential of this approach by presenting a selection of results obtained for practical test cases. These include problems from viscous fluid flow, chemically reactive flow, elasto-plasticity, radiative transfer, and optimal control. Throughout the paper, open theoretical and practical problems are stated together with references to the relevant literature},

abstract = {The fast marching method (FMM) is an efficient technique to solve numerically the Eikonal equation. The parallelization of the FMM is not easy because of its intrinsic sequential nature. In this paper we propose a novel approach to parallelize the FMM. It leads to an equation-dependent domain decomposition and it turns out to be particularly suitable for machines with two or four cores that are in common use today. Compared to other techniques in the field, the proposed method is much simpler to implement and it gives a slightly better computational speed-up. In order to test the new method on a real-world application, we solve the shape-from-shading problem based on a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. On a standard four-core machine, the method confirms the good properties. It shows a reasonable speedup factor of about 2.5, and it reveals its potential to good performance if the arithmetic density of the problem is high. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tide–surge–wave interaction is important in determining the nearshore 3D-current profile and the total water elevation. Liverpool Bay, northwest England, is used to assess the impact of coupling the 3rd generation spectral WAve Model (WAM), modified for shallow water, to the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS), a tide–surge model, through 2-way interactions. Data are readily available from the Irish Sea Observatory to quantify the importance of each coupled term with the aim of producing the most accurate model setup for coastal forecasting. A storm event, 18th January 2007, has been hindcast to investigate extreme tide–surge–wave condition both offshore and inshore. The coupled terms investigated include standard processes already included (bottom friction, surface stress and the Doppler shift of the waves by the depth-averaged current), as well as advanced coupling procedures: use of the 3D current in the wave physics and calculation of radiation stress and Stokes' drift. During storm conditions it is found that the radiation stress is the most important term in this shallow water application as wave-setup increases coastal flood risk. However, WAM runs in near real time, making this model only practical for research purposes. Further work is therefore required to simplify this model setup.},

abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) used in geospatial analysis like the simulation of geophysical flows, such as floods, landslides, and block and ash flows, differ in resolution, acquisition time and generation methodology, which results in varied representation of topographic features. This study investigates the effects of DEMs on the output of a granular flow model, TITAN2D by comparing the output using different DEMs to that obtained with a "true" representation of the terrain, which is considered to be that obtained by using TOPSAR 5 m data. Seven DEMs at four resolutions from four sources were used for Mammoth Mountain, California, a cumulodome volcano. TITAN2D was run for seven different locations of an eruption of a potential dome and two different collapse volumes. The resulting outputs were subsequently compared with TOPSAR 5 m output, and qualitative and statistical inferences were drawn. DEMs with different resolutions and sources generated different outputs that led to different flow maps. For moderate and smaller scale flows (O(104) m3 - O(105)m3), different representations can affect the computation of accurate footprint of the flow and fine DEM resolution is critical for correct characterization of these flows. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the numerical difficulties related to the appearance of the so-called wet/dry fronts that may occur during the simulation of free-surface waves in shallow fluids and internal waves in stratified fluids composed by two shallow layers of immiscible liquids. In the one-layer case, the fluid is supposed to be governed by the shallow water equations. In the case of two layers, the system to solve is formulated under the form of two-coupled system of shallow water equations. In both cases, the discretization of the equations are performed by means of the Q-schemes of Roe upwinding the source term developed in  1. and 2. for the one-layer system, and [3] for the two-layer system. These schemes satisfy the so-called C-property: they solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest. In order to handle properly with wet/dry fronts, a numerical scheme has to verify also an extended C-property: it has to solve exactly steady solutions corresponding to water at rest including wet/dry transitions. In  4., 5. and 6., some numerical schemes satisfying this property has been obtained. In this paper, we propose an improvement of these schemes and its extension to two-layer systems. We present some numerical results: for one-layer fluids, we compare the numerical results with some measurements corresponding to a physical model. For two-layer systems, we use the numerical scheme to perform a lock-exchange experiment, and we verify its validity by comparing the steady state reached with an approximate solution obtained by Armi and Farmer in 7. and 8. by using a simplified model.},

@article{Ceniceros,
abstract = {We present a variable time step, fully adaptive in space, hybrid method for the accurate simulation of incompressible two-phase flows in the presence of surface tension in two dimensions. Themethod is based on the hybrid level set/front-tracking approach proposed in [H. D. Ceniceros and A. M. Roma, J. Comput. Phys., 205, 391- 400, 2005]. Geometric, interfacial quantities are computed from front-tracking via the immersed-boundary setting while the signed distance (level set) function, which is evaluated fast and to machine precision, is used as a fluid indicator. The surface ten- sion force is obtained by employing the mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian representation introduced in [S. Shin, S. I. Abdel-Khalik, V. Daru and D. Juric, J. Comput. Phys., 203, 493-516, 2005] whose success for greatly reducing parasitic currents has been demon- strated. The use of our accurate fluid indicator together with effective Lagrangian marker control enhance this parasitic current reduction by several orders of magni- tude. To resolve accurately and efficiently sharp gradients and salient flowfeatureswe employ dynamic, adaptivemesh refinements. This spatial adaption is used in concert with a dynamic control of the distribution of the Lagrangian nodes along the fluid in- terface and a variable time step, linearly implicit time integration scheme. We present numerical examples designed to test the capabilities and performance of the proposed approach as well as three applications: the long-time evolution of a fluid interface un- dergoing Rayleigh-Taylor instability, an example of bubble ascending dynamics, and a drop impacting on a free interface whose dynamics we compare with both existing numerical and experimental data.},

@article{Charbonnier2008,
abstract = {A series of pristine block-and-ash flow deposits from the May–June 2006 eruption of Merapi represent an exceptional record of small-volume pyroclastic flows generated by gravitational lava-dome collapses over a period of about two months. The deposits form nine overlapping lobes reaching \~{}\&\#xa0;7 km from the summit in the Gendol River valley on the volcano's southern flank, which were produced by successive flows generated during and after the major dome-collapse event on June 14. Both, single pulse (post-June 14 events) and multiple-pulse pyroclastic flows generated by sustained dome collapses on June 14 are recognised and three types of deposits, spread over an area of 4.7 km², are distinguished, totalling 13.3\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;106 m3: (1) valley-confined basal avalanche deposits (11.7\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;106 m3) in the Gendol River valley, (2) overbank pyroclastic-flow and associated surge deposits (1.4\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;106 m3), where parts of the basal avalanche spread laterally onto interfluves and were subsequently channeled into the surrounding river valleys and (3) dilute ash-cloud surge deposits (0.2\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;106 m3) along valley margins. Variations in the distribution, surface morphology and lithology of the deposits are related to the source materials involved in individual pyroclastic-flow-forming events and varying modes of transport and deposition of the different flows. Inferred flow velocities of the largest block-and-ash flows generated on June 14 vary from 43.8–13.5 m/s for the basal avalanche and from 62.6–24.2 m/s for the ash-cloud surge. The minimum temperatures range from 400 °C for the basal avalanche to 165 °C for the overlying ash cloud. Due to the potential of being re-channeled into adjacent river valleys and flowing laterally away from the main river channel, the overbank pyroclastic flows are considered the most hazardous part of the block-and-ash flow system. The conditions that lead to their development during flow transport and deposition must be taken into account when assessing future pyroclastic flow hazards at Merapi and similar volcanoes elsewhere. },

abstract = {The fast marching method published by Sethian [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,93 (1996), pp. 1591–1595] is an optimally efficient algorithm for solving problems of front evolution where the front speed is monotonic. It has been used in a wide variety of applications such as robotic path planning [R. Kimmel and J. Sethian, Fast Marching Methods for Computing Distance Maps and Shortest Paths, Tech. Report 669, CPAM, University of California, Berkeley, 1996], crack propagation [M. Stolarska et al., Internat. J. Numer. Methods Engrg., 51 (2001), pp. 943– 960; N. Sukumar, D. L. Chopp, and B. Moran, Extended finite element method and fast marching method for three-dimensional fatigue crack propagation, J. Comput. Phys., submitted], seismology [J. Sethian and A. Popovici, Geophysics, 64 (1999), pp. 516–523], photolithography [J. Sethian, Fast marching level set methods for three-dimensional photolithography development, in Proceedings of the SPIE 1996 International Symposium on Microlithography, Santa Clara, CA, 1996], and medical imaging [R. Malladi and J. Sethian, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93 (1996), pp. 9389–9392]. It has also been a valuable tool for the implementation of modern level set methods where it is used to efficiently compute the distance to the front and/or an extended velocity function. In this paper, we improve upon the second order fast marching method of Sethian [SIAM Rev., 41 (1999), pp. 199–235] by constructing a second order approximation of the interface generated from local data on the mesh. The data is interpolated on a single box of the mesh using a bicubic approximation. The distance to the front is then calculated by using a variant of Newton’s method to solve both the level curve equation and the orthogonality condition for the nearest point to a given node. The result is a second order approximation of the distance to the interface which can then be used to produce second order accurate initial conditions for the fast marching method and a third order fast marching method.},

abstract = {In the context of a posteriori error estimation for nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations, the state-of-the-practice is to use adjoint approaches which require the solution of a backward-in-time problem defined by a linearization of the forward problem. One of the major obstacles in the practical application of these approaches is the need to store, or recompute, the forward solution to define the adjoint problem and to evaluate the error representation. This study considers the use of data compression techniques to approximate forward solutions employed in the backward-in-time integration. The development derives an error representation that accounts for the difference between the standard-approach and the compressed approximation of the forward solution. This representation is algorithmically similar to the standard representation and only requires the computation of the quantity of interest for the forward solution and the data-compressed reconstructed solution (i.e. scalar quantities that can be evaluated as the forward problem is integrated). This approach is then compared with existing techniques, such as checkpointing and time-averaged adjoints. Finally, we provide numerical results indicating the potential efficiency of our approach on a transient diffusion–reaction equation and on the Navier–Stokes equations. These results demonstrate memory compression ratios up to 450× while maintaining reasonable accuracy in the error-estimates.},

Traditional Monte-Carlo methods are too expensive to apply to complex models of vehicle systems since each sample requires significant effort. The proposed method based on the theory of spectral expansions of the random variables requires an order of magnitude less effort. The methodology is applied to simulations of Child Restraint Systems (CRS) where statistics on the output quantities of Head Injury Criteria and strain at selected points in the CRS shell are evaluated under the assumption of uncertain input elastic modulus and friction parameters.},

Note that we do not attempt here to characterize$\backslash$nthe inherent randomness of such flow events. We focus here on the$\backslash$nproblem of characterizing uncertainty in model output due to lack$\backslash$nof knowledge of such input for a particular event. Methods applied$\backslash$ninclude classical Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling and more$\backslash$nrecent stochastic collocation, polynomial chaos, spectral projection$\backslash$nand a newly developed extension thereof named polynomial chaos quadrature.$\backslash$nThe simple and robust samplings based Monte Carlo type methods are$\backslash$nusually computationally intractable for reasonable physical models,$\backslash$nwhile the more sophisticated and computationally efficient polynomial$\backslash$nchaos method often breaks down for complex models. The spectral projection$\backslash$nand polynomial chaos quadrature methods discussed here produce results$\backslash$nof quality comparable to the polynomial chaos type methods while$\backslash$npreserving the simplicity and robustness of the Monte Carlo-type$\backslash$nsampling based approaches at much lower cost. The computational efficiency,$\backslash$nhowever, degrades with increasing numbers of random variables. A$\backslash$nprocedure for converting the output uncertainty characterization$\backslash$ninto a map showing the probability of a hazard threshold being exceeded$\backslash$nis also presented. The uncertainty quantification procedures are$\backslash$napplied first in simple settings to illustrate the procedure and$\backslash$nthen subsequently applied to the 1991 block-and-ash flows at Colima$\backslash$nVolcano, Mexico.},

By introducing a new way of managing propagation interfaces which avoid the use of expensive data structures, the fast iterative method reveals to be a faster variant with a higher parallel potential compared to the fast marching method. We investigate in this paper a multi-level parallel approach for the fast iterative method which is well fitted for today heterogenous and hierarchical architectures. We show experiment results which focus on the fine-grained parallel level of the algorithm and we give a performance analysis. © The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption in Iceland provided a unique opportunity to quantify the evolution of proglacial geomorphology during a series of volcanogenic jokulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) (>140 events). Time-lapse imagery and repeat terrestrial laser scans before and directly after the eruption show that the jokulhlaup of 14 April 2010 composed 61\% of the 57 x 106 m3 total discharge of the combined events, and had the highest peak discharge for the two main flood events, but only deposited 18\% of the total volume of sediment in front of Gigjokull glacier. The majority of sediments (67\% of a total volume of 17.12 x 106 m3) were deposited by the 15 April 2010 jokulhlaup, and this was followed by extensive reworking by a series of smaller jokulhlaups over the following 29 days that deposited 15\% of the total sediment. The geomorphological and sedimentary signatures of the two largest jokulhlaups associated with the onset of the eruption have either been reworked by later floods or are buried by later flood deposits. Consequently, the ice-proximal, posteruption landscape cannot be used to reconstruct the characteristics or magnitudes of either of the two largest jokulhlaups. The findings support a complex-response model in which peak discharge and the bulk of the sediment transported is decoupled by changing routing mechanisms and water:sediment ratios during the eruption.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the constitutive laws of a hydraulic dynamic model, the Savage–Hutter (S–H) model, and the Hungr model. To overcome their limitations, we adopt a frictional viscoplastic constitutive law for dense granular flow and propose a new constitutive law-based dynamic model for avalanches by simplifying the internal stresses for shallow granular flow. The range of the earth pressure coefficient in each model is studied and compared. Finally, we compare the previous experimental results with those obtained from the proposed model and the S–H model, and we find that the new model can capture the flow properties of an avalanche.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new two-layer model of Savage–Hutter type to study submarine avalanches. A layer composed of fluidized granular material is assumed to flow within an upper layer composed of an inviscid fluid (e.g. water). The model is derived in a system of local coordinates following a non-erodible bottom and takes into account its curvature. We prove that the model verifies an entropy inequality, preserves water at rest for a sediment layer and their solutions can be seen as particular solutions of incompressible Euler equations under hydrostatic assumptions. Buoyancy effects and the centripetal acceleration of the grain movement due to the curvature of the bottom are considered in the definition of the Coulomb term. We propose a two-step Roe type solver to discretize the presented model. It exactly preserves water at rest and no movement of the sediment layer, when its angle is smaller than the angle of repose, and up to second order all stationary solutions. Finally, some numerical tests are performed by simulating submarine and sub-aerial avalanches as well as the generated tsunami.},

abstract = {Catastrophic landslides often extend for surprisingly long distances, a trend consolidated by a decrease in the apparent friction coefficient with an increasing landslide volume. However, there is not yet a physical model able to predict the long distances traveled by landslides in the condition of deformation. A two-dimensional model for simulating catastrophic landslide motion is presented in this paper and is based on a lump model for thermo-poro-elastic mediums. The model can concurrently simulate landslide dynamic processes, and pore pressure and frictional heating evolution in the shear zone at the bottom of a landslide. These are based upon the shallow-seated groundwater table assumption and depth-averaged integration, as well as the thermo-poro-elastic approach. A combined computational method based on the finite volume method and Crank–Nicolson method is proposed to solve the coupled equations. Four computational experiments have been run and the numerical results indicate that frictional heating enhances pore water pressure and reduces the friction, resulting in higher mobility and longer distances traveled. The value of pore water pressure can also influence the deformation process of a landslide.},

abstract = {To simulate complex flows involving wet-dry fronts in irregular terrains over arbitrary beds, this paper presents a 2D well-balanced shallow water flow model, based on an unstructured cell-centered finite volume scheme. In this model, hydrostatic reconstruction is applied to reconstruct non-negative water depths at wet-dry interfaces. Harten, Lax and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored is employed to compute the fluxes of mass and momentum. In addition, the splitting point-implicit method is utilized to solve the friction source terms. The novel aspects of the model include the adaptive method and the slope source term treatment. The former is devised to prevent unphysical high velocities occurring in the part of the domain with varying thin water and topography. The latter converts the slope source terms of a cell into fluxes through its edges and takes account of the influence of wet-dry fronts, so as to satisfy the C-property in any case on unstructured grids. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed model are extensively verified against several benchmark tests as well as a real dam-break event, where its superiority in simulating complex flows with wetting and drying over uneven bed is emphasized.},

We scrutinize the available literature on information regarding these assumptions and thus delineate the ranges of validity of the proposed model equations. The discussion is limited to relatively large snow avalanches with negligible powder snow component and laboratory sand avalanches starting on steep slopes. The conclusion of the analysis is that the SH model is a valid model for sand avalanches, but its Mohr-Coulomb sliding law may have to be complemented for snow avalanches by a second velocity-dependent contribution. For very small snow avalanches and for laboratory avalanches starting on moderately steep and bumpy slopes it may not be adequate.},

@article{Isaac2015,
abstract = {The majority of research on efficient and scalable algorithms in computational science and engineering has focused on the forward problem: given parameter inputs, solve the governing equations to determine output quantities of interest. In contrast, here we consider the broader question: given a (large-scale) model containing uncertain parameters, (possibly) noisy observational data, and a prediction quantity of interest, how do we construct efficient and scalable algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the data (the deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate the resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue predictions with quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty propagation problem)? We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end, data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on loss of grounded ice to the ocean. The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data come from satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter, represented by a heterogeneous coefficient in a Robin boundary condition at the base of the ice sheet. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean. We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction process—measured in number of forward (and adjoint) ice sheet model solves—is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and the number of processor cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact that, despite their large size, the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model parameters. This property can be exploited to construct a low rank approximation of the linearized parameter-to-observable map via randomized SVD methods and adjoint-based actions of Hessians of the data misfit functional.},

abstract = {The majority of research on efficient and scalable algorithms in computational science and engineering has focused on the forward problem: given parameter inputs, solve the governing equations to determine output quantities of interest. In contrast, here we consider the broader question: given a (large-scale) model containing uncertain parameters, (possibly) noisy observational data, and a prediction quantity of interest, how do we construct efficient and scalable algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the data (the deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate the resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue predictions with quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty propagation problem)? We present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end, data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on sea level. The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning fluid. The observational data come from InSAR satellite measurements of surface ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the basal sliding parameter. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean. We show that the work required for executing this data-to-prediction process is independent of the state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and number of processor cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact that the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model parameters. This property can be exploited to construct a low rank approximation of the linearized parameter-to-observable map.},

@article{Iverson2001a,
abstract = {A new mathematical model developed to predict behavior of debris flows and avalanches also holds promise for predicting behavior of debris-laden flash floods. The model assumes that debris flows behave as mixutres of interacting Newtonian fluids and Coulomb solids. Solid and fluid constituents obey three-dimensional mass and momentum balances, which are summed and depth-integrated to yield equations that describe shallow flows of the miture as whole. An important distinction between these mixute equations and standard shallow-water equations results from strong variation of flow resistance due to interacting solid and fluid forces. Partitioning of flow reistance between solid and fluid comonents depends on fluid pressure, which evolves as flow evlosves. If fluid pressure supports the total weight of the flowing mass, all resistance results from hydrodynamic forces, and the equationsreduce to the conventional shallow-water from. If fluid pressure supports none of the weight of the flowing mass, all flow resistance results from Coulomb friction between interacting solids, and the equations describe motion of granular avalanches,. A combination of solid and fluid resistance typifies debris flows and debris-laden flash floods. In these flows solid resitance commonly is concentrated at the fronts of advancing bores that may be heavily freighted with rocks and woody debris. Rieman methods provide an effective tool for solving the shallow flow equations numerically and predicting unsteady motion of debris flows and flash floods along paths with arbitrary geometry and inclintion.},

The formulation is suitable for discretizations using finite elements of any topology and order, or other approaches such as isogeometric and finite volume methods. Furthermore, the approach builds on standard level set tools and can therefore be used to augment existing implementations of level set methods with discrete conservation properties. Implementations of the method are tested on several difficult two- and three-dimensional problems, including two incompressible air/water flow problems with available experimental results. Linear and quadratic approximations on unstructured tetrahedral and trilinear approximations on hexahedral meshes were tested. Global conservation and agreement with experiments as well as computations by other researchers are obtained. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {We present a phase-field model (PFM) for solidification in binary alloys, which is found from the phase-field model for a pure material by direct comparison of the variables for a pure material solidification and alloy solidification. The model appears to be equivalent with the Wheeler-Boettinger-McFadden (WBM) model [A.A. Wheeler, W. J. Boettinger, and G. B. McFadden, Phys. Rev. A 45, 7424 (1992)], but has a different definition of the free energy density for interfacial region. An extra potential originated from the free energy density definition in the WBM model disappears in this model. At a dilute solution limit, the model is reduced to the Tiaden et al. model [Physica D 115, 73 (1998)] for a binary alloy. A relationship between the phase-field mobility and the interface kinetics coefficient is derived at a thin-interface limit condition under an assumption of negligible diffusivity in the solid phase. For a dilute alloy, a steady-state solution of the concentration profile across the diffuse interface is obtained as a function of the interface velocity and the resultant partition coefficient is compared with the previous solute trapping model. For one dimensional steady-state solidification, where the classical sharp-interface model is exactly soluble, we perform numerical simulations of the phase-field model: At low interface velocity, the simulated results from the thin-interface PFM are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. As the partition coefficient becomes close to unit at high interface velocities, whereas, the sharp-interface PFM yields the correct answer.},

We show here that such applications can be parallelized easily if we use a good spatially local ordering of all data for organizing storage, distribution and access, and schedule computation using a `owner-computes' rule. This ordering results in a global index space which can be partitioned to distribute the data, locally used in hashing schemes and B-trees for the necessary dynamic memory management, and used in designing efficient solution schemes.},

Inspired by the mean reversion principle and the confidence weighted on-line learning technique, CWMR models a portfolio vector as Gaussian distribu- tion, and sequentially updates the distribution by following the mean reversion trading principle. The CWMR strategy is able to effectively exploit the power of mean reversion for on-line portfo- lio selection.

@article{Liang2009,
abstract = {Many natural terrains have complicated surface topography. The simulation of steep-fronted flows that occur after heavy rainfall flash floods or as inundation from dyke breaches is usually based on the non-linear shallow water equations in hyperbolic conservation form. Particular challenges to numerical modellers are posed by the need to balance correctly the flux gradient and source terms in Godunov-type finite volume shock-capturing schemes and by the moving wet–dry boundary as the flood rises or falls. This paper presents a Godunov-type shallow flow solver on adaptive quadtree grids aimed at simulating flood flows as they travel over natural terrain. By choosing the stage and discharge as dependent variables in the hyperbolic non-linear shallow water equations, a new deviatoric formulation is derived that mathematically balances the flux gradient and source terms in cases where there are wet–dry fronts. The new formulation is more general in application than previous a priori approaches. Three benchmark tests are used to validate the solver, and include steady flow over a submerged hump, flow disturbances propagating over an elliptical-shaped hump, and free surface sloshing motions in a vessel with a parabolic bed. The model is also used to simulate the propagation of a flood due to a dam break over an initially dry floodplain containing three humps.},

abstract = {Since the seminal work of [Sussman, M, Smereka P, Osher S. A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow. J Comput Phys 1994;114:146–59] on coupling the level set method of [Osher S, Sethian J. Fronts propagating with curvature-dependent speed: algorithms based on Hamilton–Jacobi formulations. J Comput Phys 1988;79:12–49] to the equations for two-phase incompressible flow, there has been a great deal of interest in this area. That work demonstrated the most powerful aspects of the level set method, i.e. automatic handling of topological changes such as merging and pinching, as well as robust geometric information such as normals and curvature. Interestingly, this work also demonstrated the largest weakness of the level set method, i.e. mass or information loss characteristic of most Eulerian capturing techniques. In fact, [Sussman M, Smereka P, Osher S. A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow. J Comput Phys 1994;114:146–59] introduced a partial differential equation for battling this weakness, without which their work would not have been possible. In this paper, we discuss both historical and most recent works focused on improving the computational accuracy of the level set method focusing in part on applications related to incompressible flow due to both of its popularity and stringent accuracy requirements. Thus, we discuss higher order accurate numerical methods such as Hamilton–Jacobi WENO [Jiang G-S, Peng D. Weighted ENO schemes for Hamilton–Jacobi equations. SIAM J Sci Comput 2000;21:2126–43], methods for maintaining a signed distance function, hybrid methods such as the particle level set method [Enright D, Fedkiw R, Ferziger J, Mitchell I. A hybrid particle level set method for improved interface capturing. J Comput Phys 2002;183:83–116] and the coupled level set volume of fluid method [Sussman M, Puckett EG. A coupled level set and volume-of-fluid method for computing 3d and axisymmetric incompressible two-phase flows. J Comput Phys 2000;162:301–37], and adaptive gridding techniques such as the octree approach to free surface flows proposed in [Losasso F, Gibou F, Fedkiw R. Simulating water and smoke with an octree data structure, ACM Trans Graph (SIGGRAPH Proc) 2004;23:457–62].},

abstract = {We develop and test a new two-layer model for granular landslide motion and tsunami wave generation. The landslide is described as a saturated granular flow, accounting for intergranular stresses governed by Coulomb friction. Tsunami wave generation is simulated by the three-dimensional non-hydrostatic wave model NHWAVE, which is capable of capturing wave dispersion efficiently using a small number of discretized vertical levels. Depth-averaged governing equations for the granular landslide are derived in a slope-oriented coordinate system, taking into account the dynamic interaction between the lower-layer granular landslide and upper-layer water motion. The model is tested against an analytical solution for granular dam-break flow and 2D and 3D laboratory experiments on impulsive wave generation by subaerial granular landslides. Model results illustrate a complex interplay between the granular landslide and tsunami waves, and they reasonably predict not only the tsunami wave generation but also the granular landslide motion from initiation to deposition.},

abstract = {An approach to utilizing adaptive mesh refinement algorithms for storm surge modeling is proposed. Currently numerical models exist that can resolve the details of coastal regions but are often too costly to be run in an ensemble forecasting framework without significant computing resources. The application of adaptive mesh refinement algorithms substantially lowers the computational cost of a storm surge model run while retaining much of the desired coastal resolution. The approach presented is implemented in the GeoClaw framework and compared to ADCIRC for Hurricane Ike along with observed tide gauge data and the computational cost of each model run.},

@article{Min2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we consider reinitializing level functions through equation ??t + sgn(??0)(||?????|| - 1 = 0[16]. The method of Russo and Smereka [11] is taken in the spatial discretization of the equation. The spatial discretization is, simply speaking, the second order ENO finite difference with subcell resolution near the interface. Our main interest is on the temporal discretization of the equation. We compare the three temporal discretizations: the second order Runge-Kutta method, the forward Euler method, and a Gauss- Seidel iteration of the forward Euler method. The fact that the time in the equation is fictitious makes a hypothesis that all the temporal discretizations result in the same result in their stationary states. The fact that the absolute stability region of the forward Euler method is not wide enough to include all the eigenvalues of the linearized semi-discrete system of the second order ENO spatial discretization makes another hypothesis that the forward Euler temporal discretization should invoke numerical instability. Our results in this paper contradict both the hypotheses. The Runge-Kutta and Gauss-Seidel methods obtain the second order accuracy, and the forward Euler method converges with order between one and two. Examining all their properties, we conclude that the Gauss-Seidel method is the best among the three. Compared to the Runge-Kutta, it is twice faster and requires memory two times less with the same accuracy. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The quantification of uncertainty in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions is both a significant challenge and an important goal. Probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods have been used to propagate uncertainty from model inputs to outputs when input uncertainties are large and have been characterized chaos (PC) methods have found increased use in probabilistic UQ over the past decade. This review describes the use of PC expansions for the representation of random variables/fields and discusses their utility for the propagation of uncertainty in computational models, focusing on CFD models. Many CFD applications are considered, including flow in porous media, incompressible and compressible flows, and thermofluid and reacting flows. The review examines each application area, focusing on the demonstrated use of PC UQ and the associated challenges. Cross-cutting challenges with time unsteadiness and long time horizons are also discussed.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework allowing one to extend some general concepts related to the numerical approximation of 1-d conservation laws to the more general case of first order quasi-linear hyperbolic systems. In particular this framework is intended to be useful for the design and analysis of well-balanced numerical schemes for solving balance laws or coupled systems of conservation laws. First, the concept of path-conservative numerical schemes is introduced, which is a generalization of the concept of conservative schemes for systems of conservation laws. Then, we introduce the general definition of approximate Riemann solvers and give the general expression of some well-known families of schemes based on these solvers: Godunov, Roe, and relaxation methods. Finally, the general form of a high order scheme based on a first order path-conservative scheme and a reconstruction operator is presented.},

The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are crucial elements of these tools being successful. We present here a new simulation tool for dry granular avalanches using several new techniques for enhancing numerical solution accuracy. Highlights of our new methodology are the use of a depth-averaged model of the conservation laws and an adaptive grid Godunov solver to solve the resulting equations. The software is designed to run on distributed memory supercomputers and makes use of digital elevation data dynamically, i.e., refine the grid and input data to finer resolutions to better capture flow features as the flow evolves. Our simulations are validated using quantitative and qualitative comparisons to tabletop experiments and data from field observations. Our software is freely available and uses only publicly available libraries and hence can be used on a wide range of hardware and software platforms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present two error estimation approaches for bounding or correcting the error in functional estimates such as lift or drag. Adjoint methods quantify the error in a particular output functional that results from residual errors in approximating the solution to the partial differential equation. Defect methods can be used to bound or reduce the error in the entire solution, with corresponding improvements to functional estimates. Both approaches rely on smooth solution reconstructions and may be used separately or in combination to obtain highly accurate solutions with asymptotically sharp error bounds. The adjoint theory is presented for both smooth and shocked problems; numerical experiments confirm fourth-order error estimates for a pressure integral of shocked quasi-1D Euler flow. By employing defect and adjoint methods together and accounting for errors in approximating the geometry, it is possible to obtain functional estimates that exceed the order of accuracy of the discretization process and the reconstruction approach. Superconvergent drag estimates are obtained for subsonic Euler flow over a lifting airfoil. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

@article{Pudasaini2005,
abstract = {This paper is an extension of the single-phase cohesionless dry granular avalanche model over curved and twisted channels proposed by Pudasaini and Hutter (2003). It is a generalisation of the Savage and Hutter (1989, 1991) equations based on simple channel topography to a two-phase fluid-solid mixture of debris material. Important terms emerging from the correct treatment of the kinematic and dynamic boundary condition, and the variable basal topography are systematically taken into account. For vanishing fluid contribution and torsion-free channel topography our new model equations exactly degenerate to the previous Savage-Hutter model equations while such a degeneration was not possible by the Iverson and Denlinger (2001) model, which, in fact, also aimed to extend the Savage and Hutter model. The model equations of this paper have been rigorously derived; they include the effects of the curvature and torsion of the topography, generally for arbitrarily curved and twisted channels of variable channel width. The equations are put into a standard conservative form of partial differential equations. From these one can easily infer the importance and influence of the pore-fluid-pressure distribution in debris flow dynamics. The solid-phase is modelled by applying a Coulomb dry friction law whereas the fluid phase is assumed to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Input parameters of the equations are the internal and bed friction angles of the solid particles, the viscosity and volume fraction of the fluid, the total mixture density and the pore pressure distribution of the fluid at the bed. Given the bed topography and initial geometry and the initial velocity profile of the debris mixture, the model equations are able to describe the dynamics of the depth profile and bed parallel depth-averaged velocity distribution from the initial position to the final deposit. A shock capturing, total variation diminishing numerical scheme is implemented to solve the highly non-linear equations. Simulation results present the combined effects of curvature, torsion and pore pressure on the dynamics of the flow over a general basal topography. These simulation results reveal new physical insight of debris flows over such non-trivial topography. Model equations are applied to laboratory avalanche and debris-flow-flume tests. Very good agreement between the theory and experiments is established.},

(AD), with the goal of equipping the reader for the other papers in this book. AD is the systematic
application of the familiar rules of calculus to computer programs, yielding programs for the
propagation of numerical values of first, second, or higher derivatives. AD can be regarded as
traversing the code list (or computational graph) in the forward mode, the reverse mode, or a
combination of the two. Algorithms for numerical optimization, differential equations, and interval
analysis all could use AD technology to compute the required derivatives. AD typically is
implemented by using either source code transformation or operator overloading. We give examples of
code for each. Finally, we outline some pitfalls of AD for naive users, and we present opportunities
for future research.},

Discrete and continuous equations governing the transport of discretization error are developed and it is shown that the truncation error acts as the local source for these equations. Examination of the truncation error in generalized coordinates provides insight into the role of mesh quality (mesh stretching for the 1D case) in the discretization error. Numerical results are presented for 1D steady-state Burgers equation at Reynolds numbers of 32 and 128. Four different approaches for driving mesh adaption are implemented for this case: solution gradients, solution curvature, discretization error, and truncation error. The truncation-error based adaption is shown to provide superior results for both cases. Finally, two approaches for estimating the truncation error are also discussed which would allow truncation error-based adaption to be implemented for complex numerical methods.},

abstract = {A new numerical code for simulating granular avalanches, TITAN2D, was used to model block-and-ash flows from the 1991-1999 eruptions of Colima Volcano, Mexico. The block-and-ash flows were simulated on a gridded Digital Elevation Model(DEM), which was prepared and imported using a standard GIS function library (GRASS). The TITAN2D program is based upon a model for an incompressible Coulomb continuum, a ’shallow-water’ granular flow. The conservation equations for mass and momentum are solved with a Coulomb-type friction term at the interface between the granular material and the basal surface. It is assumed that conservation of energy can be neglected to first order because the coarse grain size typical of the basal avalanche results in minimal thermal effects on avalanche propagation. The resulting hyperbolic system of equations is solved using a parallel, adaptive mesh, Godunov scheme. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) API allows for computing on multiple processors, which increases computational power, decreases computing time, and allows the use of large data sets. Adaptive gridding allows for the concentration of computing power on regions of special interest. Mesh refinement captures leading edge of the avalanche, as well as locations where the topography changes rapidly. Mesh unrefinement is applied where solution values are relatively constant or small. There were thousands of rockfalls and numerous block-and-ash flows during the 1991-1999 eruptions of Colima Volcano, with volumes ranging from a few cubic meters to \$10ˆ6\$ m\$ˆ3\$. We have records of numerous flows, which include volume, run out distance, deposit area, and in some cases a videotape record of flow propagation. The flows originated from a vent plugging dome, lava flows or minor column collapse. All flows followed cross-slope concavities on the upper edifice, and channels or relative topographic lows on the lower edifice. The flows propagated for distances up to 4 km from the source. We are investigating whether, for a given flow volume, the TITAN2D model approximates run out distances. The model does have difficulty resolving cross-slope extent of the flows in areas where the natural flow was confined within channel walls that were poorly resolved on the DEM.},

abstract = {The 18–24 January 1913 eruption of Colima Volcano consisted of three eruptive phases that produced a complex sequence of tephra fall, pyroclastic surges and pyroclastic flows, with a total volume of 1.1 km3 (0.31 km3 DRE). Among these events, the pyroclastic flows are most interesting because their generation mechanisms changed with time. They started with gravitanional dome collapse (block-and-ash flow deposits, Merapi-type), changed to dome collapse triggered by a Vulcanian explosion (block-and-ash flow deposits, Soufri\`{e}re-type), then ended with the partial collapse of a Plinian column (ash-flow deposits rich in pumice or scoria,). The best exposures of these deposits occur in the southern gullies of the volcano where Heim Coefficients (H/L) were obtained for the various types of flows. Average H/L values of these deposits varied from 0.40 for the Merapi-type (similar to the block-and-ash flow deposits produced during the 1991 and 1994 eruptions), 0.26 for the Soufri\`{e}re-type events, and 0.17–0.26 for the column collapse ash flows. Additionally, the information of 1991, 1994 and 1998–1999 pyroclastic flow events was used to delimit hazard zones. In order to reconstruct the paths, velocities, and extents of the 20th Century pyroclastic flows, a series of computer simulations were conducted using the program \{FLOW3D\} with appropriate Heim coefficients and apparent viscosities. The model results provide a basis for estimating the areas and levels of hazard that could be associated with the next probable worst-case scenario eruption of the volcano. Three areas were traced according to the degree of hazard and pyroclastic flow type recurrence through time. Zone 1 has the largest probability to be reached by short runout (\&lt;5 km) Merapi and Soufri\`{e}re pyroclastic flows, that have occurred every 3 years during the last decade. Zone 2 might be affected by Soufriere-type pyroclastic flows (∼9 km long) similar to those produced during phase \{II\} of the 1913 eruption. Zone 3 will only be affected by pyroclastic flows (∼15 km long) formed by the collapse of a Plinian eruptive column, like that of the 1913 climactic eruption. Today, an eruption of the same magnitude as that of 1913 would affect about 15,000 inhabitants of small villages, ranches and towns located within 15 km south of the volcano. Such towns include Yerbabuena, and Becerrera in the State of Colima, and Tonila, San Marcos, Cofradia, and Juan Barrag\'{a}n in the State of Jalisco. },

abstract = {Rock, snow and ice masses are often dislodged on steep slopes of mountainous regions. The masses, which typically are in the form of innumerable discrete blocks or granules, initially accelerate down the slope until the angle of inclination of the bed approaches the horizontal and bed friction eventually brings them to rest. The present paper describes an initial investigation which considers the idealized problem of a finite mass of material released from rest on a rough inclined plane. The granular mass is treated as a frictional Coulomb-like continuum with a Coulomb-like basal friction law. Depth-averaged equations of motion are derived; they bear a superficial resemblance to the nonlinear shallow-water wave equations. Two similarity solutions are found for the motion. They both are of surprisingly simple analytical form and show a rather unanticipated behaviour. One has the form of a pile of granular material in the shape of a parabolic cap and the other has the form of an M-wave with vertical faces at the leading and trailing edges. The linear stability of the similarity solutions is studied. A restricted stability analysis, in which the spread is left unperturbed shows them to be stable, suggesting that mathematically both are possible asymptotic wave forms. Two numerical finite-difference schemes, one of Lagrangian, the other of Eulerian type, are presented. While the Eulerian technique is able to reproduce the M-wave similarity solution, it appears to give spurious results for more general initial conditions and the Lagrangian technique is best suited for the present problem. The numerical predictions are compared with laboratory experiments of Huber (1980) involving the motion of gravel released from rest on a rough inclined plane. Although in these experiments the continuum approximation breaks down at large times when the gravel layer is only a few particle diameters thick, the general features of the development of the gravel mass are well predicted by the numerical solutions.},

abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

abstract = {Fast Marching Methods are numerical schemes for computing solutions to the nonlinear Eikonal equation and related static Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Based on entropy satisfying upwind schemes and fast sorting techniques, they yield consistent, accurate, and highly efficient algorithms. They are optimal in the sense that the computational complexity of the algorithms is O(N logN), where N is the total number of points in the domain. The schemes are of use in a variety of applications, including problems in shape offsetting, computing distances from complex curves and surfaces, shape-fromshading, photolithographic development, computing first arrivals in seismic travel times, construction of shortest geodesics on surfaces, optimal path planning around obstacles, and visibility and reflection calculations. In this paper, we review the development of these techniques, including the theoretical and numerical underpinnings; provide details of the computational schemes, including higher order versions; and demonstrate the techniques in a collection of different areas.},

abstract = {The Titan2D geophysical mass-flow model is evaluated by comparing its simulation results and those obtained from another flow model, FLOW3D, with published data on the 1963 Little Tahoma Peak avalanches on Mount Rainier, Washington. The avalanches, totaling approximately 10??106 m3 of broken lava blocks and other debris, traveled 6.8 km horizontally and fell 1.8 km vertically (H/L=0.246). Velocities calculated from runup range from 24 to 42 m/s and may have been as high as 130 m/s while the avalanches passed over Emmons Glacier. Titan2D is a code for an incompressible Coulomb continuum; it is a depth-averaged, 'shallow-water', granular-flow model. The conservation equations for mass and momentum are solved with a Coulomb-type friction term at the basal interface. The governing equations are solved on multiple processors using a parallel, adaptive mesh, Godunov scheme. Adaptive gridding dynamically concentrates computing power in regions of special interest; mesh refinement and coarsening key on the perimeter of the moving avalanche. The model flow initiates as a pile defined as an ellipsoid by a height (z) and an elliptical base defined by radii in the x and y planes. Flow parameters are the internal friction angle and bed friction angle. Results from the model are similar in terms of velocity history, lateral spreading, location of runup areas, and final distribution of the Little Tahoma Peak deposit. The avalanches passed over the Emmons Glacier along their upper flow paths, but lower in the valley they traversed stream gravels and glacial outwash deposits. This presents difficulty in assigning an appropriate bed friction angle for the entire deposit. Incorporation of variable bed friction angles into the model using GIS will help to resolve this issue. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes an efficient and systematic process for using geophysical computer model simulations to guide efforts in probabilistic hazard mapping. The framework being proposed requires the simultaneous construction of many (\$10\^{}2\$--\$10\^{}4\$) statistical emulators, e.g., cheap model surrogates. This paper describes an automation process for choosing designs for and fitting these emulators. Throughout the description of this process, several useful modifications to standard emulators are explored. Additionally, this approach enables a fast and flexible uncertainty quantification for multiple sources of aleatory variability (natural randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in geophysical and statistical models) in the context of probabilistic hazard mapping. This process is illustrated through an application to granular volcanic flows.},

The scheme relies on graph-based algorithms and low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of the graph. This procedure involves representing both the parameter space and physical space by a weighted graph. A combination of clustering and low rank approximation is then used to create a good approximation of the original graph. By performing a multiscale data sampling, a well-conditioned basis of a low rank Gaussian kernel matrix, is identified and used for out-of-sample extensions used in generating the hazard maps.},

abstract = {The choice of an appropriate bed friction value to model simulations of natural materials is diffi cult. This problem is compounded when the application involves terrain with greatly diff erent surface properties. The Little Tahoma Peak avalanches of 1963 present an extreme case that illustrates this issue. Here the avalanches passed over the Emmons Glacier for the upper half of their extent but rode over stream gravels and glacial outwash for the lower part of their runout. The avalanches also passed over bedrock and forested soils. Intuitively the basal friction for each of these terrains should be diff erent making the selection of a representative value very diffi cult. The ability to assign specifi c bed friction angles that are appropriate for geographically distinct areas would be extremely useful. We explore this in the context of the Titan2D code which uses a depth-averaged, thin-layer, model of granular fl ow with a Coulomb-type friction term at the basal interface. The governing equations are solved on multiple processors using an adaptive mesh, Godunov scheme. Adaptive grid- ding dynamically concentrates computing power in regions of special interest ; mesh refi nement resolves key features of the avalanche. Previous simulations have shown that a single bed friction cannot adequately match velocity, pile height and runout. This inadequacy has been signifi cantly reduced by integrating a spatially variable bed friction through the use of a GIS layer. Pile velocity, runup heights and deposit morphology of simulations run with variable bed friction are closer to those of the actual avalanches.},

abstract = {Maps of areas potentially affected by block-and-ash flows and associated ash clouds are here presented for the Volc\'{a}n de Colima. TITAN2D 2.0.1 code has been used to simulate block-and-ash flows using as an input volume that of the actual summit dome (assessed at 2×106m3), while the Energy Cone model has been used to delimit the possible inundated area from associated ash clouds. Both Merapi- and Soufriere-type block-and-ash flows were generated using different basal friction angles and maintaining fixed the volume and the internal friction angle. The setting of the input parameters takes into account some flow characteristics, such as the stepwise aggradation of different pulses that piled up to form the total thickness of the block-and-ash flow deposits. The outputs of the computational routines are reported as two maps describing the total thickness of the final deposits. They predict that thick deposits will engulf the ravines descending from the main cone to the west, south and southeast, with expected maximum runouts between 4.5 and 7km. The associated ash clouds have slightly longer runouts, and the model predicts they will inundate some higher grounds that are not affected by the concentrate underflows. The presented maps represent useful tools for managing the current block-and-ash flow hazard at Volc\'{a}n de Colima.},

Crucial to the above method was a new iteration method for maintaining the level set function as the signed distance from the zero level set. In this paper we implement a "constraint" along with higher order difference schemes in order to make the iteration method more accurate and efficient. Accuracy is measured in terms of the new computed signed distance function and the original level set function having the same zero level set. We apply our redistancing scheme to incompressible flows with noticeably better resolved results at reduced cost. We validate our results with experiment and theory. We show that our "distance level set scheme" with the added constraint competes well with available interface tracking schemes for basic advection of an interface. We perform basic accuracy checks and more stringent tests involving complicated interfacial structures. As with all level set schemes, our method is easy to implement.},

abstract = {Adjoint equations of differential equations have seen widespread applications in optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty quantification. A major challenge in solving adjoint equations for time dependent systems has been the need to use the solution of the original system in the adjoint calculation and the associated memory requirement. In applications where storing the entire solution history is impractical, checkpointing methods have frequently been used. However, traditional checkpointing algorithms such as revolve require a priori knowledge of the number of time steps, making these methods incompatible with adaptive time stepping. We propose a dynamic checkpointing algorithm applicable when the number of time steps is a priori unknown. Our algorithm maintains a specified number of checkpoints on the fly as time integration proceeds for an arbitrary number of time steps. The resulting checkpoints at any snapshot during the time integration have the optimal repetition number. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated both analytically and experimentally in solving adjoint equations. This algorithm also has significant advantage in automatic differentiation when the length of execution is variable. © 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

@article{Williams2014,
abstract = {Geophysical mass flow models are numerical models that approximate pyroclastic flow events and can be used to assess the volcanic hazards certain areas may face. One such model, TITAN2D, approximates granular-flow physics based on a depth-averaged analytical model using inputs of basal and internal friction, material volume at a coordinate point, and a GIS in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). The volume of modeled material propagates over the DEM in a way that is governed by the slope and curvature of the DEM surface and the basal and internal friction angles. Results from TITAN2D are highly dependent upon the inputs to the model. Here we focus on a single input: the DEM, which can vary in resolution. High resolution DEMs are advantageous in that they contain more surface details than lower-resolution models, presumably allowing modeled flows to propagate in a way more true to the real surface. However, very high resolution DEMs can create undesirable artifacts in the slope and curvature that corrupt flow calculations. With high-resolution DEMs becoming more widely available and preferable for use, determining the point at which high resolution data is less advantageous compared to lower resolution data becomes important. We find that in cases of high resolution, integer-valued DEMs, very high-resolution is detrimental to good model outputs when moderate-to-low (<10-15°) slope angles are involved. At these slope angles, multiple adjacent DEM cell elevation values are equal due to the need for the DEM to approximate the low slope with a limited set of integer values for elevation. The first derivative of the elevation surface thus becomes zero. In these cases, flow propagation is inhibited by these spurious zero-slope conditions. Here we present evidence for this "terracing effect" from 1) a mathematically defined simulated elevation model, to demonstrate the terracing effects of integer valued data, and 2) a real-world DEM where terracing must be addressed. We discuss the effect on the flow model output and present possible solutions for rectification of the problem.},

@article{Worthen2014,
abstract = {We address the problem of inferring mantle rheological parameter fields from surface velocity observations and instantaneous nonlinear mantle flow models. We formulate this inverse problem as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear least squares optimization problem governed by nonlinear Stokes equations. We provide expressions for the gradient of the cost functional of this optimization problem with respect to two spatially-varying rheological parameter fields: the viscosity prefactor and the exponent of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor. Adjoint (linearized) Stokes equations, which are characterized by a 4th order anisotropic viscosity tensor, facilitates efficient computation of the gradient. A quasi-Newton method for the solution of this optimization problem is presented, which requires the repeated solution of both nonlinear forward Stokes and linearized adjoint Stokes equations. For the solution of the nonlinear Stokes equations, we find that Newton’s method is significantly more efficient than a Picard fixed point method. Spectral analysis of the inverse operator given by the Hessian of the optimization problem reveals that the numerical eigenvalues collapse rapidly to zero, suggesting a high degree of ill-posedness of the inverse problem. To overcome this ill-posedness, we employ Tikhonov regularization (favoring smooth parameter fields) or total variation (TV) regularization (favoring piecewise-smooth parameter fields). Solution of two- and three-dimensional finite element-based model inverse problems show that a constant parameter in the constitutive law can be recovered well from surface velocity observations. Inverting for a spatially-varying parameter field leads to its reasonable recovery, in particular close to the surface. When inferring two spatially varying parameter fields, only an effective viscosity field and the total viscous dissipation are recoverable. Finally, a model of a subducting plate shows that a localized weak zone at the plate boundary can be partially recovered, especially with TV regularization.},

An efficient and accurate numerical scheme is presented and implemented for the coupled nonlinear systems of Navier–Stokes type linear momentum equations and volume preserving Allen–Cahn type phase equations. Detailed numerical simulations for a Newtonian fluid filament falling into another ambient Newtonian fluid are carried out. The dynamical scaling behavior and the pinch-off behavior, as well as the formation of the consequent satellite droplets are investigated. },

@article{Yavari-Ramshe2015,
abstract = {This paper introduces a well-balanced second-order finite volume scheme, based on the Q-scheme of Roe, for simulating granular type flows. The proposed method is applied to solve the incompressible Euler equations under Savage–Hutter assumptions. The model is derived in a local coordinate system along a non-erodible bed to take its curvature into account. Moreover, simultaneous appearance of flowing/static regions is simulated by considering a basal friction resistance which keeps the granular flow from moving when the angle of granular flow is less than the angle of repose. The proposed scheme preserves stationary solutions up to second order and deals with different situations of wet/dry transitions by a modified nonlinear wet/dry treatment. Numerical results indicate the improved properties and robustness of the proposed finite volume structure. In addition, the granular flow properties are estimated with a computational error of less than 5\%. These errors are consistently less than those obtained by using similar existing finite volume schemes without the proposed modifications, which can result in up to 30\% overestimation.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Intensity inhomogeneity often occurs in real-world images, which presents a considerable challenge in image segmentation. The most widely used image segmentation algorithms are region-based and typically rely on the homogeneity of the image intensities in the regions of interest, which often fail to provide accurate segmentation results due to the intensity inhomogeneity. This paper proposes a novel region-based method for image segmentation, which is able to deal with intensity inhomogeneities in the segmentation. First, based on the model of images with intensity inhomogeneities, we derive a local intensity clustering property of the image intensities, and define a local clustering criterion function for the image intensities in a neighborhood of each point. This local clustering criterion function is then integrated with respect to the neighborhood center to give a global criterion of image segmentation. In a level set formulation, this criterion defines an energy in terms of the level set functions that represent a partition of the image domain and a bias field that accounts for the intensity inhomogeneity of the image. Therefore, by minimizing this energy, our method is able to simultaneously segment the image and estimate the bias field, and the estimated bias field can be used for intensity inhomogeneity correction (or bias correction). Our method has been validated on synthetic images and real images of various modalities, with desirable performance in the presence of intensity inhomogeneities. Experiments show that our method is more robust to initialization, faster and more accurate than the well-known piecewise smooth model. As an application, our method has been used for segmentation and bias correction of magnetic resonance (MR) images with promising results.},
